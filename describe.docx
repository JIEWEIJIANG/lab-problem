1)
The outer loop  runs "sz - 1" times
inner loop runs "sz - interate1 -1" times on average for each iteration of the outer loop
set "x" be the size of array 'arr'
then outer loop runs sz-1, which is O(n)
then inner loop runs (n-1) + (n+2) + ... +1 times, which sums up to n * n / 2
therefore the time of algorithm is O(n * n)

2)
Label the bag from 1 to 20,
take one M&M from bag 1, two from 2...., weight all these M&M together on the scale
total weight should be 1+2+3...+20 = 210
if total more than 210 it means that bag with 1.1 contributed to the extra weight
difference between the total weight and 210 grams will tell which bag has the heavier M&Ms
